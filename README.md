Big O Lunch
===========

The problems we do for Groupon Engineering Chicago's lunchtime
programming problems group, pushed out Î©(log n).

If you enjoy solving hard and interesting problems, and like working
with smart, fast, critically-thinking-yet-simpatico people, send in a
great solution and hit me up.

### What?

At Groupon Chicago, we pose a moderately challenging algorithmic/data
structure-y problem every week or two, discussing approaches and
comparing solutions at a comfortable pace (i.e. no rushing through
things to get to the next problem). On the World Wide Web (WWW), feel
free to peruse, criticize, solve, and submit at your leisure.

Things we can look at that are not often enough explored in this
sort of group:

1. Parallelizable and otherwise scalable solutions.
2. Characteristically functional vs. imperative solutions.
3. Mathematical analysis complemented with real benchmarking.

### Why?

1. Because it's fun.
2. To keep developing our [chops](http://www.sweetwater.com/insync/chops/).
3. Because a well-defined and posed programming problem can smell an
   awful lot like well-compartmentalized and specified business logic.

### When?

1. Right now: there's an easy intro problem up: see
   [problem 0](00_minfreek/).
2. \[Redacted Groupon-specific stuff\]
3. See http://samizdat.mines.edu/howto/HowToBeAProgrammer.html#id2854560
4. Take 3) with n grains of salt, where n is an integer determined by
   your employer/manager.
   
### How?

Just fork it and submit a pull request based on the `solutions`
branch, with your work in the following format:

`/<problem-directory>/<your-@-name>/<your-work>`

e.g.

`/00_minfreek/senorflor/the_answer.rb`

or

```
/00_minfreek/senorflor/java/...
/00_minfreek/senorflor/clj/...
/00_minfreek/senorflor/cobol/...
```

Tests, harnesses, benchmarking results, multiple languages/solutions,
and problem variations are all welcome, as your recreational time
allows.

Again, pull requests should be based on/submitted to the `solutions`
branch; `master` is for people who want a clean run at things.
Everyone who's interested should watch the repo--feel free to
fetch, run, comment and bang on each other's solutions, documented for
all to see and learn from on the PR. No squashing/force pushing once
submissions go to PR, please--I think it would be more educational to
fellow implementers/readers for the history of review and revision to
remain unaltered. I will merge PRs once they have a goodly amount of
comments and revisions, for the benefit of future historians.
